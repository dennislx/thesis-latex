	abstract = {The increasing utilization of social media provides a vast and new source of user-generated ecological data (digital traces), which can be automatically collected for research purposes. The availability of these data sets, combined with the convergence between social and computer sciences, has led researchers to develop automated methods to extract digital traces from social media and use them to predict individual psychological characteristics and behaviors. In this article, we reviewed the literature on this topic and conducted a series of meta-analyses to determine the strength of associations between digital traces and specific individual characteristics; personality, psychological well-being, and intelligence. Potential moderator effects were analyzed with respect to type of social media platform, type of digital traces examined, and study quality. Our findings indicate that digital traces from social media can be studied to assess and predict theoretically distant psychosocial characteristics with remarkable accuracy. Analysis of moderators indicated that the collection of specific types of information (i.e., user demographics), and the inclusion of different types of digital traces, could help improve the accuracy of predictions.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the proposed generic framework of Cyber-Physical Social Systems (CPSS) for Multidimensional Urban Mobility (MUM). The introduction of air mobility will increase the complexity of urban mobility management due to the increase of data (real-time information exchange), services, and infrastructure. This paper first summarizes the shift of the smart mobility and associated concerns and emphasizes the smart technologies to be introduced for efficient deployment of the MUM. Afterwards, the state-of-the-art on CPSS present the details of the research work in the context of CPSS data management process and challenges related with data. In conclusion, a framework to address the various challenges associated with the data paradigm is proposed.},
