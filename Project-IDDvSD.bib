There is an increasing debate about the impact of mental health screening. We illustrate the use of a decision making framework that can be applied when there is no sufficient data to support a traditional cost‐benefit analysis.

Methods
We conducted secondary analyses of data from 459 male prisoners who were screened upon intake. We compared the potential benefit of different approaches (screening, history taking, and universal interventions) to allocating treatment resources using decision curve analysis.

Results
Screening prisoners for distress at typical levels of sensitivity (75\%) and specificity (71\%) were estimated to provide the greatest net benefit if between 2 and 5 false positives per detected illness are tolerable. History taking and self‐harm screening provide the largest net benefit when only 1 or 2 false positives per detected illness would be tolerable. The benefits of screening were less among those without a recent psychiatric history, ethnic minorities, and those with fewer psychosocial needs.

Conclusions
Although screening has potential to increase detection of treatment, important subgroup differences exist. Greater consideration of responses to positive screens or alternatives to screening are needed to maximize the impact of efforts to improve detection and treatment of mental illness.},

The two studies focus on evaluating the psychometric properties of the ease of use and usefulness scales, while examining the relationship between ease of use, usefulness, and system usage. Study 1 provides a strong assessment of the convergent validity of the two scales by examining heterogeneous user groups dealing with heterogeneous implementations of messaging technology. In addition, because one might expect users to share similar perspectives about voice and electronic mail, the study also represents a strong test of discriminant validity. In this study a total of 118 respondents from 10 different organizations were surveyed for their attitudes toward two messaging technologies: voice and electronic mail. Study 2 complements the approach taken in Study 1 by focusing on the ability to demonstrate discriminant validity. Three popular software applications (WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and Harvard Graphics) were examined based on the expectation that they would all be rated highly on both scales. In this study a total of 73 users rated the three packages in terms of ease of use and usefulness. The results of the studies demonstrate reliable and valid scales for measurement of perceived ease of use and usefulness. In addition, the paper tests the relationships between ease of use, usefulness, and usage using structural equation modelling. The results of this model are consistent with previous research for Study 1, suggesting that usefulness is an important determinant of system use. For Study 2 the results are somewhat mixed, but indicate the importance of both ease of use and usefulness. Differences in conditions of usage are explored to explain these findings.},

FCM is used to explore and potentially extract apriori unknown concepts from the text that may explain the business outcome, without the need to provide any human-predefined labels on concepts. FCM is explicitly configured to increase recovered-concept diversity, concept relevance, and sparsity for enhanced concept coherence and corpus-level insights. FCM embeds words, documents, and concepts all in the same vector space, enabling easy interpretation of discovered concepts by associating words local to the concept vector.We evaluate FCM using a dataset of online purchase journey data containing the reviews read by each consumer. Compared to 6 interpretable baselines, FCM attains higher interpretability as quantified by 2 human-judged metrics and 1 automated metric, and higher recall of unique concepts as supported by several experiments. In addition, FCM extracted constructs relating to product quality theorized to impact conversion in literature, without being explicitly trained to do so, by getting focused by an outcome variable (conversion). FCM also achieves superior predictive performance compared to 6 interpretable benchmarks while maintaining superior or competitive predictive performance compared to prediction-focused blackbox classifiers. In further experiments, we evaluate FCM on text data from online newsgroups and a crowdfunding platform, investigate the impact of focusing on concept discovery, and study the interpretability-accuracy trade-off. We present FCM as a complementary technique to explore and understand text data before applying standard causal inference techniques. We conclude by discussing managerial implications, potential business applications, limitations, and ideas for future development.},

We present a sequence of pre-registered experiments (N = 3, 800) in which we showed participants functionally identical models that varied only in two factors commonly thought to make machine learning models more or less interpretable: the number of features and the transparency of the model (i.e., whether the model internals are clear or black box). Predictably, participants who saw a clear model with few features could better simulate the model’s predictions. However, we did not find that participants more closely followed its predictions. Furthermore, showing participants a clear model meant that they were less able to detect and correct for the model’s sizable mistakes, seemingly due to information overload. These counterintuitive findings emphasize the importance of testing over intuition when developing interpretable models.},

	abstract = {Background Postural instability and gait disability threaten the independence and well-being of people with Parkinson’s disease and increase the risk of falls and fall-related injuries. Prospective research has shown that commonly-used clinical assessments of balance and walking lack the sensitivity to accurately and consistently identify those people with Parkinson’s disease who are at a higher risk of falling. Wearable sensors provide a portable and affordable alternative for researchers and clinicians who are seeking to objectively assess movements and falls risk in the clinical setting. However, no consensus currently exists on the optimal placements for sensors and the best outcome measures to use for assessing standing balance and walking stability in Parkinson’s disease patients. Hence, this systematic review aimed to examine the available literature to establish the best sensor types, locations and outcomes to assess standing balance and walking stability in this population. Methods Papers listed in three electronic databases were searched by title and abstract to identify articles measuring standing balance or walking stability with any kind of wearable sensor among adults diagnosed with PD. To be eligible for inclusion, papers were required to be full-text articles published in English between January 1994 and December 2014 that assessed measures of standing balance or walking stability with wearable sensors in people with PD. Articles were excluded if they; i) did not use any form of wearable sensor to measure variables associated with standing balance or walking stability; ii) did not include a control group or control condition; iii) were an abstract and/or included in the proceedings of a conference; or iv) were a review article or case study. The targeted search of the three electronic databases identified 340 articles that were potentially eligible for inclusion, but following title, abstract and full-text review only 26 articles were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Included articles were assessed for methodological quality and relevant data from the papers were extracted and synthesized. Results Quality assessment of these included articles indicated that 31\% were of low methodological quality, while 58\% were of moderate methodological quality and 11\% were of high methodological quality. All studies adopted a cross-sectional design and used a variety of sensor types and outcome measures to assess standing balance or walking stability in people with Parkinson’s disease. Despite the typically low to moderate methodological quality, 81\% of the studies reported differences in sensor-based measures of standing balance or walking stability between different groups of Parkinson’s disease patients and/or healthy controls. Conclusion These data support the use of wearable sensors for detecting differences in standing balance and walking stability between people with PD and controls. Further high-quality research is needed to better understand the utility of wearable sensors for the early identification of Parkinson’s disease symptoms and for assessing falls risk in this population.

More recently, techniques from the field of machine learning have been applied to neurocritical care patient data to develop models with high levels of predictive accuracy. However, although these recent models appear clinically promising, their interpretability has often not been considered and they tend to be black box models, making it extremely difficult to understand how the model came to its conclusion. Interpretable machine learning methods have the potential to provide the means to overcome some of these issues but are largely unexplored within the neurocritical care domain. This article examines existing models used in neurocritical care from the perspective of interpretability. Further, the use of interpretable machine learning will be explored, in particular the potential benefits and drawbacks that the techniques may have when applied to neurocritical care data. Finding a solution to the lack of model explanation, transparency, and accountability is important because these issues have the potential to contribute to model trust and clinical acceptance, and, increasingly, regulation is stipulating a right to explanation for decisions made by models and algorithms. To ensure that the prospective gains from sophisticated predictive models to neurocritical care provision can be realized, it is imperative that interpretability of these models is fully considered.},

Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.},

The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process. A total of 128 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of new machine learning techniques will be developed.},

Traditional ways to diagnose the disease rely on in-person subjective clinical evaluations on the quality of a set of activity tests. The high-resolution longitudinal activity data collected by smartphone applications nowadays make it possible to conduct remote and convenient health assessment. However, out-of-lab tests often suffer from poor quality controls as well as irregularly collected observations, leading to noisy test results. To address these issues, we propose a novel time-series based approach to predicting Parkinson's Disease with raw activity test data collected by smartphones in the wild. The proposed method first synchronizes discrete activity tests into multimodal features at unified time points. Next, it distills and enriches local and global representations from noisy data across modalities and temporal observations by two attention modules. With the proposed mechanisms, our model is capable of handling noisy observations and at the same time extracting refined temporal features for improved prediction performance.

To address this issue, an evolutionary attention-based LSTM training with competitive random search is proposed for multivariate time series prediction. By transferring shared parameters, an evolutionary attention learning approach is introduced to LSTM. Thus, like that for biological evolution, the pattern for importance-based attention sampling can be confirmed during temporal relationship mining. To refrain from being trapped into partial optimization like traditional gradient-based methods, an evolutionary computation inspired competitive random search method is proposed, which can well configure the parameters in the attention layer.

	abstract = {A patient’s clinical notes correspond to a sequence of free-form text documents generated by healthcare professionals over time. Rich and unique information in clinical notes is useful for clinical decision making. In this work, we propose a time-aware transformer-based hierarchical architecture, which we call Flexible Time-aware LSTM Transformer (FTL-Trans), for classifying a patient’s health state based on her series of clinical notes. FTL-Trans addresses the problem that current transformer-based architectures cannot handle, which is the multi-level structure inherent in clinical note series where a note contains a sequence of chucks and a chuck contains further a sequence of words. At the bottom layer, FTL-Trans encodes equal-length subsequences of a patient’s clinical notes ("chunks") into content embeddings using a pre-trained ClinicalBERT model. Unlike ClinicalBERT, however, FTL-Trans merges each content embedding and sequential information into a new position-enhanced chunk representation in the second layer by an augmented multi-level position embedding. Next, the time-aware layer tackles the irregularity in the spacing of notes in the note series by learning a flexible time decay function and utilizing the time decay function to incorporate both the position-enhanced chunk embedding and time information into a patient representation. This patient representation is then fed into the top layer for classification. Together, this hierarchical design of FTL-Trans successfully captures the multi-level sequential structure of the note series. Our extensive experimental evaluation conducted using multiple patient cohorts extracted from the MIMIC dataset illustrates that, while addressing the aforementioned issues, FTL-Trans consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures up to 5\% in AUROC and 6\% in Accuracy.},

	abstract = {In the study of various diseases, heterogeneity among patients usually leads to different progression patterns and may require different types of therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is important to study patient subtyping, which is grouping of patients into disease characterizing subtypes. Subtyping from complex patient data is challenging because of the information heterogeneity and temporal dynamics. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been successfully used in many domains for processing sequential data, and recently applied for analyzing longitudinal patient records. The LSTM units are designed to handle data with constant elapsed times between consecutive elements of a sequence. Given that time lapse between successive elements in patient records can vary from days to months, the design of traditional LSTM may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel LSTM unit called Time-Aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to handle irregular time intervals in longitudinal patient records. We learn a subspace decomposition of the cell memory which enables time decay to discount the memory content according to the elapsed time. We propose a patient subtyping model that leverages the proposed T-LSTM in an auto-encoder to learn a powerful single representation for sequential records of patients, which are then used to cluster patients into clinical subtypes. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed T-LSTM architecture captures the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities.},

Previous studies have largely focused cross-sectional (single) CT data. Herein, we consider longitudinal data. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model addresses learning with regularly spaced time points (i.e., equal temporal intervals). However, clinical imaging follows patient needs with often heterogeneous, irregular acquisitions. To model both regular and irregular longitudinal samples, we generalize the LSTM model with the Distanced LSTM (DLSTM) for temporally varied acquisitions. The DLSTM includes a Temporal Emphasis Model (TEM) that enables learning across regularly and irregularly sampled intervals. Briefly, (1) the temporal intervals between longitudinal scans are modeled explicitly, (2) temporally adjustable forget and input gates are introduced for irregular temporal sampling; and (3) the latest longitudinal scan has an additional emphasis term. We evaluate the DLSTM framework in three datasets including simulated data, 1794 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) scans, and 1420 clinically acquired data with heterogeneous and irregular temporal accession. The experiments on the first two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on both simulated and regularly sampled datasets (e.g. improve LSTM from 0.6785 to 0.7085 on F1 score in NLST). In external validation of clinically and irregularly acquired data, the benchmarks achieved 0.8350 (CNN feature) and 0.8380 (LSTM) on area under the ROC curve (AUC) score, while the proposed DLSTM achieves 0.8905.},

To tackle these limitations, we propose an attention-based time-aware LSTM Networks (ATTAIN), to improve the interpretability of LSTM and to identify the critical previous events for current diagnosis by modeling the inherent time irregularity.

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly disabling and typically runs a recurrent course. Knowledge about prevention of relapse and recurrence is crucial to the long-term welfare of people who suffer from this disorder. This article provides an overview of the current evidence for the prevention of relapse and recurrence using psychological interventions. We first describe a conceptual framework to preventive interventions based on: acute treatment; continuation treatment, or; prevention strategies for patients in remission. In brief, cognitive-behavioral interventions, delivered during the acute phase, appear to have an enduring effect that protects patients against relapse and perhaps others from recurrence following treatment termination. Similarly, continuation treatment with either cognitive therapy or perhaps interpersonal psychotherapy appears to reduce risk for relapse and maintenance treatment appears to reduce risk for recurrence. Preventive relapse strategies like preventive cognitive therapy or mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) applied to patients in remission protects against subsequent relapse and perhaps recurrence. There is some preliminary evidence of specific mediation via changing the content or the process of cognition. Continuation CT and preventive interventions started after remission (CBT, MBCT) seem to have the largest differential effects for individuals that need them the most. Those who have the greatest risk for relapse and recurrence including patients with unstable remission, more previous episodes, potentially childhood trauma, early age of onset. These prescriptive indications, if confirmed in future research, may point the way to personalizing prevention strategies. Doing so, may maximize the efficiency with which they are applied and have the potential to target the mechanisms that appear to underlie these effects. This may help make this prevention strategies more efficacious.},

	abstract = {Image recognition with prototypes is considered an interpretable alternative for black box deep learning models. Classification depends on the extent to which a test image “looks like” a prototype. However, perceptual similarity for humans can be different from the similarity learned by the classification model. Hence, only visualising prototypes can be insufficient for a user to understand what a prototype exactly represents, and why the model considers a prototype and an image to be similar. We address this ambiguity and argue that prototypes should be explained. We improve interpretability by automatically enhancing visual prototypes with quantitative information about visual characteristics deemed important by the classification model. Specifically, our method clarifies the meaning of a prototype by quantifying the influence of colour hue, shape, texture, contrast and saturation and can generate both global and local explanations. Because of the generality of our approach, it can improve the interpretability of any similarity-based method for prototypical image recognition. In our experiments, we apply our method to the existing Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet). Our analysis confirms that the global explanations are generalisable, and often correspond to the visually perceptible properties of a prototype. Our explanations are especially relevant for prototypes which might have been interpreted incorrectly otherwise. By explaining such ‘misleading’ prototypes, we improve the interpretability and simulatability of a prototype-based classification model. We also use our method to check whether visually similar prototypes have similar explanations, and are able to discover redundancy.

In the next 30 years, this amount is estimated to double due to the increase in the number of ageing people, as age is the leading key risk feature for the start of PD. There are a variety of medications, such as levodopa available to treat PD. With the latest advancement in healthcare technology, current researches permit the monitoring of PD with the application of wearable sensor technology. From previous studies, researchers have realized the application of wearable sensors as a useful tool that had the capability to differentiate various types of PD symptoms using uni-modal sensor or bi-modal sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). Therefore, early diagnosis of PD through multimodal wearable technology can be considered for this aim. In this paper, the data are collected using on-body triaxial wearable sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) for classifying people with Parkinson (PWP) from healthy controls. The system performance was characterized based on 10-fold cross validation method, applying the proposed time and frequency domain features and classification algorithms. The strength of the proposed method has been evaluated through several performance measures. In summary, these results show that the proposed machine learning techniques had ability in differentiating PWP from healthy controls with highest average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and ROC of above 88\%.},

Given the potential significance of speech naturalness to functional and social rehabilitation outcomes, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of listener perceptions of monopitch on speech naturalness and intelligibility in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Method 

Two short utterances were extracted from monologue samples of 16 speakers with PD and 5 age-matched adults without PD. Sixteen listeners evaluated these stimuli for monopitch, speech naturalness and intelligibility using the visual sort and rate method.

Results 

Naïve listeners can reliably judge monopitch, speech naturalness, and intelligibility with minimal familiarization. While monopitch and speech intelligibility were only moderately correlated, monopitch and speech naturalness were highly correlated.

Conclusions 

A great deal of attention is currently being paid to improvement of vocal loudness and thus speech intelligibility in PD. Our findings suggest that prosodic characteristics such as monopitch should be explored as adjuncts to this treatment of dysarthria in PD. Development of such prosodic treatments may enhance speech naturalness and thus improve quality of life.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel method is proposed for the detection of Parkinson's disease with the features obtained from the speech signals. Detection and early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease are essential in terms of disease progression and treatment process. Parkinson's disease dataset used in this study was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The proposed hybrid machine learning method consists of two stages: i) data pre-processing (over-sampling), ii) classification. The Parkinson's disease dataset (PD dataset) is a two-class dataset. While 192 data belong to normal (healthy) individuals, 564 data belong to the diseased class (PD). The data set has an imbalanced class distribution. To transform this imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) method is used. Then, after converting to a balanced class distribution, Random Forests classification method was used for classification of Parkinson's disease dataset. The PD dataset consists of 753 attributes. Only the random forests classification were classified as 87.037\% in the classification of PD dataset, while the proposed hybrid method (the combination of SMOTE and random forests) achieved 94.89\% classification success. Obtained results showed that promising resultshad been achieved in discrimination of the PD dataset with this hybrid method.},

	abstract = {Spirometry test, a measure of the patient's lung function, is the gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of chronic pulmonary diseases. Spirometry is currently being done in hospital settings by having the patients blow the air out of their lungs forcefully and into the spirometer's tubes under the supervision and constant guidance of clinicians. This test is expensive, cumbersome and not easily applicable to every-day monitoring of these patients. The lung mechanism when performing a cough is very similar to when spirometry test is done. That includes a big inhalation, air compression and forceful exhalation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that obstruction of lung airways should have a similar effect on both cough features and spirometry measures. This paper explores the estimation of lung obstruction using cough acoustic features. A total number of 3695 coughs were collected from patients from 4 different conditions and 4 different severity categories along with their lung function measures in a clinical setting using a smartphone's microphone and a hospital-grade spirometry lab. After feature-set optimization and model hyperparameter tuning, the lung obstruction was estimated with MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 8\% for COPD and 9\% for asthma populations. In addition to lung obstruction estimation, we were able to classify patients' disease state with 91\% accuracy and patients' severity within each disease state with 95\% accuracy.},

Both the 30-s chair stand test (CST) and the 3-m walking test were performed and a set of kinematic parameters were obtained from a single inertial unit. A decision tree analysis was used to: 1) identify the most relevant frailty-related parameters and 2) compare validity of this classification. We found that a selected set of parameters from the 30-s CST (i.e., range of movement, acceleration, and power) were better at identifying frailty status than both the actual outcome of the test (i.e., cycles' number) and the normally used criteria (i.e., gait speed). For the pre-frail status, AUC improves from 0.531 using the actual test outcome and 0.516 with gait speed to 0.938 with the kinematic parameters criteria. In practice, this could improve the presyndrome identification and perform the appropriate actions to postpone the progression into the frail status.},

	abstract = {Attention maps are popular tools for explaining the decisions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. Typically, for each image of interest, a single attention map is produced, which assigns weights to pixels based on their importance to the classification. We argue that a single attention map provides an incomplete understanding since there are often many other maps that explain a classification equally well. In this paper, we propose to utilize a beam search algorithm to systematically search for multiple explanations for each image. Results show that there are indeed multiple relatively localized explanations for many images. However, naively showing multiple explanations to users can be overwhelming and does not reveal their common and distinct structures. We introduce structured attention graphs (SAGs), which compactly represent sets of attention maps for an image by visualizing how different combinations of image regions impact the confidence of a classifier. An approach to computing a compact and representative SAG for visualization is proposed via diverse sampling. We conduct a user study comparing the use of SAGs to traditional attention maps for answering comparative counterfactual questions about image classifications. Our results show that the users are significantly more accurate when presented with SAGs compared to standard attention map baselines.},

Recently, methods relying on visual feature prototypes have been developed for this purpose. However, in contrast to how humans categorize objects, these approaches have not yet made use of any taxonomical organization of class labels. With such an approach, for instance, we may see why a chimpanzee is classified as a chimpanzee, but not why it was considered to be a primate or even an animal. In this work we introduce a model that uses hierarchically organized prototypes to classify objects at every level in a predefined taxonomy. Hence, we may find distinct explanations for the prediction an image receives at each level of the taxonomy. The hierarchical prototypes enable the model to perform another important task: interpretably classifying images from previously unseen classes at the level of the taxonomy to which they correctly relate, e.g. classifying a hand gun as a weapon, when the only weapons in the training data are rifles. With a subset of ImageNet, we test our model against its counterpart black-box model on two tasks: 1) classification of data from familiar classes, and 2) classification of data from previously unseen classes at the appropriate level in the taxonomy. We find that our model performs approximately as well as its counterpart black-box model while allowing for each classification to be interpreted.},

In order to better transfer attribute-based knowledge from known to unknown classes, we argue that an image representation with integrated attribute localization ability would be beneficial for zero-shot learning. To this end, we propose a novel zero-shot representation learning framework that jointly learns discriminative global and local features using only class-level attributes. While a visual-semantic embedding layer learns global features, local features are learned through an attribute prototype network that simultaneously regresses and decorrelates attributes from intermediate features. We show that our locality augmented image representations achieve a new state-of-the-art on three zero-shot learning benchmarks. As an additional benefit, our model points to the visual evidence of the attributes in an image, e.g. for the CUB dataset, confirming the improved attribute localization ability of our image representation.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the health and safety of senior citizens who live alone is a growing societal concern. The Activity of Daily Living (ADL) approach is a common means to monitor disease progression and the ability of these individuals to care for themselves. However, the prevailing sensor-based ADL monitoring systems primarily rely on wearable motion sensors, capture insufficient information for accurate ADL recognition, and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of ADLs at different granularities. Current healthcare IS and mobile analytics research focuses on studying the system, device, and provided services, and is in need of an end-to-end solution to comprehensively recognize ADLs based on mobile sensor data. This study adopts the design science paradigm and employs advanced deep learning algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical, multiphase ADL recognition framework to model ADLs at different granularities. We propose a novel 2D interaction kernel for convolutional neural networks to leverage interactions between human and object motion sensors. We rigorously evaluate each proposed module and the entire framework against state-of-the-art benchmarks (e.g., support vector machines, DeepConvLSTM, hidden Markov models, and topic-modeling-based ADLR) on two real-life motion sensor datasets that consist of ADLs at varying granularities: Opportunity and INTER. Results and a case study demonstrate that our framework can recognize ADLs at different levels more accurately. We discuss how stakeholders can further benefit from our proposed framework. Beyond demonstrating practical utility, we discuss contributions to the IS knowledge base for future design science-based cybersecurity, healthcare, and mobile analytics applications.},

Our objective was to determine whether unobtrusive in-home assessment of walking speed can detect a future fall. Method: In both ISAAC and ORCATECH Living Laboratory studies, a sensor-based monitoring system has been deployed in the homes of older adults. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression models were used to explore trajectories of sensor-based walking speed metrics in those destined to fall versus controls over time. Falls were captured during a 3-year period. Results: We observed no major differences between those destined to fall (n = 55) and controls (n = 70) at baseline in clinical functional tests. There was a longitudinal decline in median daily walking speed over the 3 months before a fall in those destined to fall when compared with controls, p {\textless}. 01 (ie, mean walking speed declined 0.1 cm s-1 per week). We also found prefall differences in sensor-based walking speed metrics in individuals who experienced a fall: walking speed variability was lower the month and the week just before the fall compared with 3 months before the fall, both p {\textless}. 01. Conclusions: While basic clinical tests were not able to differentiate who will prospectively fall, we found that significant variations in walking speed metrics before a fall were measurable. These results provide evidence of a potential sensor-based risk biomarker of prospective falls in community living older adults.},

This cross-sectional study investigated the test–retest reliability of the 2-min walk test (2MWT) and its concurrent validity with the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in Ugandan patients with depression. We also explored practice effects and assessed the minimal detectable change (MDC) and clinical correlates with the 2MWT. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study executed in Butabika National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Fifty Ugandan patients with depression (15 women; median age = 29.0 years) performed twice a 2MWT, once a 6MWT, and completed the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ), and Brief Symptoms Inventory-18 (BSI-18). Results: The median (interquartile) 2MWT score on the first and second test were 125.5 (59.2) meters and 131.0 (57.0) meters (p =.28). The intraclass correlation was.96 (95\% confidence interval [0.94, 0.98]). The MDC was 23.5 m for men and 23.4 m for women. There was no evidence of a practice effect. Scores on BSI-18 depression, SIMPAQ walking, and SIMPAQ incidental physical activity explained 66.3\% of 2MWT score variance. Conclusion: The 2MWT is a reliable test, which can be conducted without any special equipment or substantial time demands, to provide a valid assessment of the functional exercise capacity in outpatients with depression.},

We show the effectiveness of ProtoPShare on the CUB-200-2011 and the Stanford Cars datasets and confirm the semantic consistency of its prototypical parts in user-study.},

Although in recent years we have witnessed increasingly popular use of deep neural networks for sequence modeling, it is still challenging to explain the rationales behind the model outputs, which is essential for building trust and supporting the domain experts to validate, critique and refine the model. We propose ProSeNet, an interpretable and steerable deep sequence model with natural explanations derived from case-based reasoning. The prediction is obtained by comparing the inputs to a few prototypes, which are exemplar cases in the problem domain. For better interpretability, we define several criteria for constructing the prototypes, including simplicity, diversity, and sparsity and propose the learning objective and the optimization procedure. ProSeNet also provides a user-friendly approach to model steering: domain experts without any knowledge on the underlying model or parameters can easily incorporate their intuition and experience by manually refining the prototypes. We conduct experiments on a wide range of real-world applications, including predictive diagnostics for automobiles, ECG, and protein sequence classification and sentiment analysis on texts. The result shows that ProSeNet can achieve accuracy on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also evaluate the interpretability of the results with concrete case studies. Finally, through user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we demonstrate that the model selects high-quality prototypes which align well with human knowledge and can be interactively refined for better interpretability without loss of performance.},

Embodiment theories suggest a reciprocal relationship between bodily expression and the way in which emotions are processed. Methods: In Study 1, the gait patterns of 14 inpatients suffering from major depression were compared with those of matched never-depressed participants. In Study 2, we employed musical mood induction to induce sad and positive mood in a sample of 23 undergraduates. A Fourier-based description of walking data served as the basis for the computation of linear classifiers and for the analysis of gait parameters. Results: Gait patterns associated with sadness and depression are characterized by reduced walking speed, arm swing, and vertical head movements. Moreover, depressed and sad walkers displayed larger lateral swaying movements of the upper body and a more slumped posture. Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that a specific gait pattern characterizes individuals in dysphoric mood. Copyright © 2009 by the American Psychosomatic Society.},

However, spatiotemporal parameters and neurophysiological mechanisms of gait have not yet been studied in depth in depression. The relationship between spatial and temporal parameters may yield insight into the pathophysiology of altered movements in depression. Therefore, gait patterns were quantitatively assessed and analysed in depressed subjects (n=16) and compared to matched healthy controls. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured during over ground walking at self-selected walking speed on a walkway previously validated in healthy subjects and used for orthopaedic and neurological patients. Compared to controls, depressed patients showed significantly lower gait velocity (p{\textless}0.001), reduced stride length (p{\textless}0.005), double limb support (p{\textless}0.005) and cycle duration (p{\textless}0.005). There was a significant correlation between cadence and gait velocity in depressed patients (r=0.51, p{\textless}0.05), but not in healthy controls (r=0.11, p{\textgreater}0.05). In patients with major depression, reduced gait velocity was associated with stride hypometria and increased cycle duration. Velocity was associated with cadence in depressed patients but not in healthy controls. The results may indicate possible deficiencies in the motor control system in depression. These first results about alterations of spatiotemporal gait patterns in depression warrant further longitudinal and experimental studies. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Link recommendation, which suggests links to connect currently unlinked users, is a key functionality offered by major online social networks. Salient examples of link recommendation include “People You May Know” on Facebook and LinkedIn as well as “You May Know” on Google+. The main stakeholders of an online social network include users (e.g., Facebook users) who use the network to socialize with other users and an operator (e.g., Facebook Inc.) that establishes and operates the network for its own benefit (e.g., revenue). Existing link recommendation methods recommend links that are likely to be established by users but overlook the benefit a recommended link could bring to an operator. To address this gap, we define the utility of recommending a link and formulate a new research problem—the utility-based link recommendation problem. We then propose a novel utility-based link recommendation method that recommends links based on the value, cost, and linkage likelihood of a link, in contrast to existing link recommendation methods that focus solely on linkage likelihood. Specifically, our method models the dependency relationship between the value, cost, linkage likelihood, and utility-based link recommendation decision using a Bayesian network; predicts the probability of recommending a link with the Bayesian network; and recommends links with the highest probabilities. Using data obtained from a major U.S. online social network, we demonstrate significant performance improvement achieved by our method compared with prevalent link recommendation methods from representative prior research.This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both have an increased risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. We conducted a study to determine whether coordinated care management of multiple conditions improves disease control in these patients. METHODS We conducted a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 14 primary care clinics in an integrated health care system in Washington State, involving 214 participants with poorly controlled diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both and coexisting depression. Patients were randomly assigned to the usual-care group or to the intervention group, in which a medically supervised nurse, working with each patient's primary care physician, provided guideline-based, collaborative care management, with the goal of controlling risk factors associated with multiple diseases. The primary outcome was based on simultaneous modeling of glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and systolic blood-pressure levels and Symptom Checklist-20 (SCL-20) depression outcomes at 12 months; this modeling allowed estimation of a single overall treatment effect. RESULTS As compared with controls, patients in the intervention group had greater overall 12-month improvement across glycated hemoglobin levels (difference, 0.58\%), LDL cholesterol levels (difference, 6.9 mg per deciliter [0.2 mmol per liter]), systolic blood pressure (difference, 5.1 mm Hg), and SCL-20 depression scores (difference, 0.40 points) (P{\textless}0.001). Patients in the intervention group also were more likely to have one or more adjustments of insulin (P=0.006), antihypertensive medications (P{\textless}0.001), and antidepressant medications (P{\textless}0.001), and they had better quality of life (P{\textless}0.001) and greater satisfaction with care for diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both (P{\textless}0.001) and with care for depression (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS As compared with usual care, an intervention involving nurses who provided guideline-based, patient-centered management of depression and chronic disease significantly improved control of medical disease and depression.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: "Meaningful use" of electronic health records to improve quality of care has remained understudied. We evaluated an approach to improving patients' safety and quality of care involving the secondary use of data from a hospital electronic prescribing and decision support system (ePDSS). METHODS: We conducted a case study of a large English acute care hospital with a well-established ePDSS. Our study was based on ethnographic observations of clinical settings (162 hours) and meetings (28 hours), informal conversations with clinical staff, semistructured interviews with ten senior executives, and the collection of relevant documents. Our data analysis was based on the constant comparative method. FINDINGS: This hospital's approach to quality and safety could be characterized as "technovigilance." It involved treating the ePDSS as a warehouse of data on clinical activity and performance. The hospital converted the secondary data into intelligence about the performance of individuals, teams, and clinical services and used this as the basis of action for improvement. Through a combination of rapid audit, feedback to clinical teams, detailed and critical review of apparent omissions in executive-led meetings, a focus on personal professional responsibility for patients' safety and quality care, and the correction of organizational or systems defects, technovigilance was-based on the hospital's own evidence-highly effective in improving specific indicators. Measures such as the rate of omitted doses of medication showed marked improvement. As do most interventions, however, technovigilance also had unintended consequences. These included the risk of focusing attention on aspects of patient safety made visible by the system at the expense of other, less measurable but nonetheless important, concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The secondary use of electronic data can be effective for improving specific indicators of care if accompanied by a range of interventions to ensure proper interpretation and appropriate action. But care is needed to avoid unintended consequences.},

In this paper we review important aspects in the WHDs area, listing the state-of-the-art of wearable vital signs sensing technologies plus their system architectures and specifications. A focus on vital signs acquired by WHDs is made: first a discussion about the most important vital signs for health assessment using WHDs is presented and then for each vital sign a description is made concerning its origin and effect on heath, monitoring needs, acquisition methods and WHDs and recent scientific developments on the area (electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, blood glucose, skin perspiration, capnography, body temperature, motion evaluation, cardiac implantable devices and ambient parameters). A general WHDs system architecture is presented based on the state-of-the-art. After a global review of WHDs, we zoom in into cardiovascular WHDs, analysing commercial devices and their applicability versus quality, extending this subject to smart t-shirts for medical purposes. Furthermore we present a resumed evolution of these devices based on the prototypes developed along the years. Finally we discuss likely market trends and future challenges for the emerging WHDs area.},

In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers promising tools for reducing the chronic disease burdens. Despite the presence of fruitful works on the use of IoT for chronic disease management in literature, these are rarely overviewed consistently. The present study provides an overview on the use of IoT for chronic disease management, followed by ranking different chronic diseases based on their priority for using IoT in the developing countries. For this purpose, a structural coding was used to provide a list of technologies adopted so far, and then latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm was applied to find major topics in literature. In order to rank chronic diseases based on their priority for using IoT, a list of common categories of chronic diseases was subjected to fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The research findings include lists of IoT technologies for chronic disease management and the most-discussed chronic diseases. In addition, with the help of text mining, a total of 18 major topics were extracted from the relevant pieces of literature. The results indicated that the cardiovascular disease and to a slightly lesser extent, diabetes mellitus are of the highest priorities for using IoT in the context of developing countries.{\textless}br{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cigarette smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. Smoking also carries an economic burden, including smoking-attributable healthcare spending. This study assessed smoking-attributable fractions in healthcare spending between 2010 and 2014, overall and by insurance type (Medicaid, Medicare, private, out-of-pocket, other federal, other) and by medical service (inpatient, non-inpatient, prescriptions). Methods: Data were obtained from the 2010–2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to the 2008–2013 National Health Interview Survey. The final sample (n = 49,540) was restricted to non-pregnant adults aged 18 years or older. Estimates from two-part models (multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models) and data from 2014 national health expenditures were combined to estimate the share of and total (in 2014 dollars) annual healthcare spending attributable to cigarette smoking among U.S. adults. All models controlled for socio-demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and attitudes. Results: During 2010–2014, an estimated 11.7\% (95\% CI = 11.6\%, 11.8\%) of U.S. annual healthcare spending could be attributed to adult cigarette smoking, translating to annual healthcare spending of more than \$225 billion dollars based on total personal healthcare expenditures reported in 2014. More than 50\% of this smoking-attributable spending was funded by Medicare or Medicaid. For Medicaid, the estimated healthcare spending attributable fraction increased more than 30\% between 2010 and 2014. Conclusions: Cigarette smoking exacts a substantial economic burden in the U.S. Continuing efforts to implement proven population-based interventions have been shown to reduce the health and economic burden of cigarette smoking nationally.},

	abstract = {In machine learning often a tradeoff must be made between accuracy and intelligibility. More accurate models such as boosted trees, random forests, and neural nets usually are not intelligible, but more intelligible models such as logistic regression, naive-Bayes, and single decision trees often have significantly worse accuracy. This tradeoff sometimes limits the accuracy of models that can be applied in mission-critical applications such as healthcare where being able to understand , validate, edit, and trust a learned model is important. We present two case studies where high-performance generalized additive models with pairwise interactions (GA 2 Ms) are applied to real healthcare problems yielding intelligible models with state-of-the-art accuracy. In the pneumonia risk prediction case study, the intelligible model uncovers surprising patterns in the data that previously had prevented complex learned models from being fielded in this domain, but because it is intelligible and modular allows these patterns to be recognized and removed. In the 30-day hospital readmission case study, we show that the same methods scale to large datasets containing hundreds of thousands of patients and thousands of attributes while remaining intelligible and providing accuracy comparable to the best (unintelligible) machine learning methods.},

The impact of high-resolution activity data collected from mobile phones is only beginning to be explored. Here we present data from mPower, a clinical observational study about Parkinson disease conducted purely through an iPhone app interface. The study interrogated aspects of this movement disorder through surveys and frequent sensor-based recordings from participants with and without Parkinson disease. Benefitting from large enrollment and repeated measurements on many individuals, these data may help establish baseline variability of real-world activity measurement collected via mobile phones, and ultimately may lead to quantification of the ebbs-and-flows of Parkinson symptoms. App source code for these data collection modules are available through an open source license for use in studies of other conditions. We hope that releasing data contributed by engaged research participants will seed a new community of analysts working collaboratively on understanding mobile health data to advance human health.

	abstract = {"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.  Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

	abstract = {Large-scale population screening and in-home monitoring for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has so far been mainly carried out by traditional healthcare methods and systems. Development of mobile health may provide an independent, future method to detect PD. Current PD detection algorithms will benefit from better generalizability with data collected in real-world situations. In this paper, we report the top-performing smartphone-based method in the recent DREAM Parkinson's Disease Digital Biomarker Challenge for digital diagnosis of PD. Utilizing real-world accelerometer records, this approach differentiated PD from control subjects with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.87 by 3D augmentation of accelerometer records, a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art methods. This study paves the way for future at-home screening of PD and other neurodegenerative conditions affecting movement.,

        , In-home digital surveillance has been proposed as the future for chronic, neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which can be monitored by wearable devices from its motor-related symptoms. However, the disparities between uncontrolled in-home environments have introduced obstacles to the population-level application of digital screening of PD. In this study, we developed the first-place solution in the recent DREAM Parkinson's Disease Digital Biomarker Challenge, which calls for optimal algorithms to extract digital biomarkers of PD from crowd-sourced movement records. To combat the spatial and temporal bias in different movement records, we applied a variety of data-augmentation methods, which significantly improves the performance of the deep-learning model. Besides PD, our method provides a path for large-scale population screening and in-home monitoring using wearable devices in other related neurodegenerative disorders., The widespread use of wearable devices in our daily life has provided an ideal platform for the management of motor-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, while the application of such systems in the real-world situation has faced many challenges from in-home environments. In this study, we show how artificial intelligence could facilitate the efficient screening of Parkinson's disease in the general population and how interpretable artificial intelligence could provide useful information to understand the motor-related pathology of Parkinson's disease.},

The receptive field size is a crucial issue in many visual tasks, as the output must respond to large enough areas in the image to capture information about large objects. We introduce the notion of an effective receptive field, and show that it both has a Gaussian distribution and only occupies a fraction of the full theoretical receptive field. We analyze the effective receptive field in several architecture designs, and the effect of nonlinear activations, dropout, sub-sampling and skip connections on it. This leads to suggestions for ways to address its tendency to be too small.},
