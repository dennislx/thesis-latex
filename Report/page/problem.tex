\section{Problem Statement}

The relevant elements necessary for a basic psychotherapy reading, is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What the main problem is (for example depression or anxiety).
    \item What triggers it (what makes the patient feel that way on a day to day basis).
    \item Examples of patient's symptoms, changes in patients behaviours and thinking.
    \item What consequence the problem has on patient's life.
\end{itemize}

An example with all the relevant elements needed, is:
``My main problem is feeling \dots''.
